	<p>The value of money is determined by the demand for it, just like the value of goods and services. There are three ways to measure the value of the dollar. The first is how much the dollar will buy in foreign currencies. Thatâ€™s what the exchange rate measures. Forex traders on the foreign exchange market determine exchange rates. They take into account supply and demand, and then factor in their expectations for the future.


		For this reason, the value of money fluctuates throughout the trading day. The second method is the value of Treasury notes. They can be converted easily into dollars through the secondary market for Treasurys.</p>

    <p>Have you ever wondered where food comes from? When we think about it, a picture of a farmer planting seeds often comes to mind. But did you know that some seeds are genetically altered in a laboratory before being planted? These seeds are called genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and they grow into genetically modified (GM) foods. Health Canada makes sure that all foods, including GM foods, are safe for us to eat. Read on to learn more about GMOs and GM foods.
    Since 1994, about 85 GM foods have been approved for sale in Canada. This includes GM foods grown in Canada and GM foods that have been imported from other countries. Only four main GM crops are currently grown in Canada including canola, soybean, corn and sugar beet. Most of these GM crops are exported to other countries.</p>

    <p>If we could go back to the year 1900 to visit our grandparents, how would they view us? Back then, Viewing our rockets, jet airplanes, TVs, computers, and Internet, they would see us as sorcerers and wizards.

But if someone from 2100 could visit us now, how would we view them? Probably like the gods of mythology. They would command everything around them by wishing for it. They would have perfect and ageless bodies. And they would ride across the universe in magical chariots. In the past, we feared the gods of mythology. In the next 100 years, we will become them.</p>
